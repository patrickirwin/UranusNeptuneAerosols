The various files associated with the various figures are:

uranus_reconstructlineA.spx: This is the combined central-meridian-line-averaged Uranus spectral file (NEMESIS format), combining the HST/STIS and IRTF/SpeX data that appears in Figs 1, 2, and 15.

neptune_reconstructlineA.spx: This is the combined central-meridian-line-averaged Neptune spectral file (NEMESIS format), combining the HST/STIS and IRTF/SpeX data that appears in Figs 1, 2, and 15.

uranus_combined_all.spx: This is the final combined Uranus spectral file (NEMESIS format) used in the final parameterised fit, containing the final HST/STIS, IRTF/SpeX and Gemini/NIFS processed datasets. It appears in Fig. 6.

neptune_combined_all.spx: This is the final combined Neptune spectral file (NEMESIS format) used in the final parameterised fit, containing the final HST/STIS, IRTF/SpeX and Gemini/NIFS processed datasets. It appears in Fig. 12.
