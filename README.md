The various files associated with the various figures are:

uranus_reconstructlineA.spx: This is the combined central-meridian-line-averaged Uranus spectral file (NEMESIS format), combining the HST/STIS and IRTF/SpeX data that appears in Figs 1, 2, and 15.

neptune_reconstructlineA.spx: This is the combined central-meridian-line-averaged Neptune spectral file (NEMESIS format), combining the HST/STIS and IRTF/SpeX data that appears in Figs 1, 2, and 15.

uranus_combined_all.spx: This is the final combined Uranus spectral file (NEMESIS format) used in the final parameterised fit, containing the final HST/STIS, IRTF/SpeX and Gemini/NIFS processed datasets. It appears in Fig. 6.

neptune_combined_all.spx: This is the final combined Neptune spectral file (NEMESIS format) used in the final parameterised fit, containing the final HST/STIS, IRTF/SpeX and Gemini/NIFS processed datasets. It appears in Fig. 12.

reflectivity_fig2.txt: This contains the modelled and calculated reflectivities of Uranus and Neptune appearing in Fig.2.

uranustrans_fig3.txt: This contains the calculated two-way transmission to different levels in Uranus's atmosphere as shown in Fig.3.

neptunetrans_fig3.txt: This contains the calculated two-way transmission to different levels in Neptune's atmosphere as shown in Fig.3.

data_export_fig4.txt: This contains the spectra, profiles and imaginary refractive index spectra plotted in Fig. 4.

uranus_cloud_contour_exp.txt: Contains the opacity/bar values at different wavelengths for Uranus shown in Fig. 5.

uranus_parametric_retrievals.tar: Contains the set of parameteric Uranus retrievals for which results are shown in Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 9. Thirty runs were initially started on the 800-900 nm range of which 26 achieved chi2/n<1 are were further retrieved here. The tarball contails 26 directories, each of which contains NEMESIS format files covering the vertical profiles, layering and scattering properties shown in the figures. Please refer to the NEMESIS manual for an explanation of the format of these files.

data_export_fig10.txt: This contains the spectra, and retrieved profiles plotted in Fig. 10.

neptune_cloud_contour_exp.txt: Contains the opacity/bar values at different wavelengths for Neptune shown in Fig. 11.

neptune_parametric_retrievals.tar: Contains the set of parameteric Neptune retrievals for which results are shown in Figs. 12, 13, 14, and 9. Thirty runs were initially started on the 800-900 nm range of which 26 achieved chi2/n<1 are were further retrieved here. The tarball contails 26 directories, each of which contains NEMESIS format files covering the vertical profiles, layering and scattering properties shown in the figures. Please refer to the NEMESIS manual for an explanation of the format of these files.

uranusmodel.txt and neptunemodel.txt: Contains the various modelled profiles shown in Fig. 20.
